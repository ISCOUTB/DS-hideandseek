The file `assets/seeker.png` is intended to contain an image. Since I cannot generate or provide image files directly, please ensure that you have the appropriate image file named `seeker.png` saved in the `assets` directory of your project. 

If you need to create or modify the image, you can use any image editing software to design your seeker character and save it as `seeker.png` in the specified directory. 

If you have any other requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
